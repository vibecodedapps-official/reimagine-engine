# revert-tests.sh: run a bundle's changed test files twice, in a copy of its head and in a
# copy of its merge-base with the test code at its head state, and write one result file
# with a verdict per file. A test file that passes in both copies does not detect the
# bundle's other changes.
#
# Usage:
#   sh revert-tests.sh run <repo> <base> <head> <keys file> <work dir> <result file>
#   sh revert-tests.sh bg <repo> <base> <head> <keys file> <work dir> <result file>
#   sh revert-tests.sh wait <result file>
#
# `bg` and `wait` let a caller whose single command may not outlast a timeout, such as an
# agent's shell tool in a headless session, run a bundle that takes longer: it starts `bg`
# in the background and repeats `wait` until it exits other than 3.
# - `bg` removes `<result file>.exit`, creates `<result file>.err`, and runs `run` as a
#   child, in its own process group, with its output in `.err`. When the child ends, `bg`
#   writes the child's exit status to `<result file>.exit.tmp` and renames it to `.exit`.
#   At REVERT_TESTS_DEADLINE seconds (default 3600) it sends the child's group TERM, and
#   KILL 60 seconds later, and adds `revert-tests: stopped at the deadline of <n> seconds`
#   to `.err`. On HUP, INT, or TERM it sends the group TERM and exits 2 without writing
#   `.exit`. When `bg` is gone without a signal (KILL), the group's leader sends the group
#   TERM within a tick, unless the group had one already, and KILL 60 seconds later;
#   `.exit` is not written.
# - `wait` checks every two ticks for at most REVERT_TESTS_WAIT seconds (default 540).
#   With `.exit` present, it prints the last line of `.err` that is not blank on stderr
#   (or, with none and a status other than 0, `revert-tests: the run ended with status
#   <n>`), so a shell's job notice before `run`'s own line is dropped, removes both files, and
#   exits 0 for status 0, else 2. With neither file present after 30 seconds (or the
#   window, when shorter), it exits 2: no run started. At the window's end it exits 3.
#
# Tick: REVERT_TESTS_TICK, whole or fractional seconds above 0 (default 1). Each poll
# sleeps one tick, `wait` checks every two ticks, and the watchdog's TERM-to-KILL grace
# (step 4) is ten ticks; every other time is in seconds, as stated.
# tests/audit/revert-tests.sh sets it low.
#
# Portability: bash (Linux, macOS, Git Bash), which the script re-executes itself under
# when another sh starts it, and awk in forms mawk, gawk, and BSD awk accept. Each command needs its
# own process group, from job control, and dash turns job control off when it has no
# controlling terminal, as under CI; bash does not. Under `set -m` bash can print
# `child setpgid (N to N): ...` at a job's start, when the child's own setpgid call fails
# after the parent's has already placed it (seen on macOS, about one start in 2000, the
# job in its own group every time); the script drops that line, and fails the start if
# the job is alive but leads no group of its own.
# Every git call only reads: rev-parse, merge-base, diff-tree, ls-tree, and cat-file.
# GIT_DIR, GIT_WORK_TREE, and GIT_INDEX_FILE from the caller are unset first.
#
# Windows: a signal that the runtime of Git for Windows delivers to a native program ends
# that program's tree by the parent ids Windows records, and Windows hands a freed id to a
# new process, so the signal can reach a process this run never started. There no group
# gets a TERM. Where another system sends one, and before the KILL at a command's end, the
# script ends the group's processes by id, in one call of Windows PowerShell: the processes
# the runtime lists in the group, those it lists under them or in a group one of them
# leads, and every Windows process under one of those that started no earlier than its
# parent. A listed process counts only if it started before the list was taken, and each
# is ended only while its id still names the process that was listed. Each query and each
# end is given 30 seconds. The KILL then goes to a group with no native program left. A
# child's TERM trap does not run, and a command ended this way has the status Windows
# reports for the process that leads it: 0 for a shell, 137 for a native program. `bg`
# stops its child's group the same way: it ends the group by id, then removes what the run
# it ended could not, the work dir (unless it was there before the run) and the result's
# `.tmp`, and at the deadline it records status 2. A lost `bg`'s leader does the same for
# the run and all under it. When the call fails, one line on stderr says so, once per
# process: a command's group then gets the KILL alone, and from `bg` or its leader the run
# alone gets the TERM, when the call left it, which it answers once any git step in the
# foreground returns. The KILL 60 seconds later goes alone. Beyond reach: a native child
# whose parent had already exited; the children of a native program that started while
# the list was taken, which the KILL ends alone; and for `bg` and its leader, any process
# that started then and a group whose own leader is gone.
#
# Keys file: one line per value, `<key><TAB><value>`. `command` (required), `setup`, and
# `timeout` (whole seconds, 1 or more, default 300) at most once; `run` (one or more) and
# `path` (none or more) once per pattern. No `path` line means the default test_paths:
# **/test/**, **/tests/**, **/__tests__/**, **/*_test.*, **/test_*.*, **/*.test.*,
# **/*.spec.*, **/*Tests/**, **/*Test.*, **/*Tests.*. Patterns follow git's glob pathspec
# rules (`*` does not cross `/`, `**` does).
#
# Work dir: must not exist. The script creates it, writes the two copies and their
# temporary and cache directories in it, and removes it on every exit. A removal that
# leaves the work dir is retried each tick for up to 10 seconds, and the retries print
# nothing; a work dir still there after that is named on stderr, with the last line of the
# last removal's error when it printed one, and the exit status is unchanged. A run that
# fails prints no such line, so its own message stays the last line on stderr.
#
# Steps:
# 1. The changed paths are those of `git diff-tree -r --no-renames` from the merge-base to
#    the head, so a rename is its old path deleted and its new path added. Test code is
#    each changed path that matches a `path` pattern. The files to run are the test-code
#    paths present at the head that match a `run` pattern, sorted, at most 20; the rest
#    are `not run: file cap`. With none, the result says `no changed tests to run`.
# 2. When the head tree or the merge-base tree holds over 1 GB of blobs, nothing runs:
#    `not run: tree over 1 GB`.
# 3. The reverted copy is the merge-base tree with each test-code path at its head state:
#    its head content and mode, or absent when the head lacks it. When a test-code path
#    and a merge-base path cannot both exist (one is a file where the other needs a
#    directory), nothing runs: `not run: path conflict`. Both copies are written from
#    `git cat-file`, as stage 1 step 6 exports a tree: a symlink as a file holding its
#    target, a submodule absent, a Git LFS pointer as the pointer file, and a path with a
#    newline, or with an empty, `.`, `..`, or `.git` component, not written. The result
#    lists each, at most 50 per kind per copy, with the count.
# 4. In each copy, from its root: `setup` with `sh -c`, then for each file
#    `sh -c '<command> "$1"' sh <path>`. The reverted copy runs only the files that
#    passed at the head, and only when the head copy's setup passed. Each command runs
#    with TMPDIR, TMP, TEMP, and XDG_CACHE_HOME in the work dir, GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES
#    set to the work dir, every GIT_* variable unset, the caller's LC_ALL, and stdin from
#    /dev/null. Each command's deadline is the smaller of `timeout` and what is left of
#    the bundle's cap, counted from the first command. The cap is 1800 seconds, or
#    REVERT_TESTS_CAP when set (whole seconds; tests/audit/revert-tests.sh sets it, so its time
#    cap case does not wait 30 minutes). Each command starts as a
#    job under `set -m`, in its own process group. At the deadline the group gets TERM,
#    then KILL ten ticks later. Whether the command ends or times out, the group then
#    gets KILL, and the script waits until no process in it is left. A process that
#    leaves the group (setsid, a daemon) is beyond reach. On Windows a native program's
#    own children are outside the group, and the deadline has no TERM (see Windows).
# 5. Verdicts per file:
#    passes at head and without the change   exit 0 in both copies
#    passes at head only                     exit 0 at the head, another status reverted
#    does not pass at head                   another status at the head, or a timeout
#    not run: <reason>                       setup failed, a timeout in the reverted
#                                            copy, a path conflict, or a cap
#    Every exit status of the command counts as a run, 126 and 127 included.
# 6. The result file is written to `<result file>.tmp` and renamed into place.
#
# Output tails are the last 80 lines of the command's output and errors, unredacted, each
# line cut at 400 bytes, with NUL and carriage return bytes removed.
#
# Exit status of `run`:
#   2  wrong arguments or keys, the work dir exists, a git step or write failed, a job
#      did not start in its own process group, or a process group was still live 10
#      seconds after KILL (one line on stderr; no result file)
#   0  the result file is written, whatever the verdicts; it can carry the one stderr line
#      that names a work dir left behind (see Work dir), or the one that says a process
#      tree was not ended by id (see Windows)
# `bg` exits 0 once `.exit` is written, else 2. `wait` exits as `run` did (0, or 2 with
# its stderr) and forwards the last line of `.err` on 0 too; it exits 2 for no run
# started or an unreadable `.exit`, and 3 while still running.
