# Publication texts

Read this file from `steps/7-publish.md` when you write a pull request body, a continued pull request comment or a ticket comment, and from `steps/4-build.md` at the end of Step 6 on a host other than `github`, to write the run's body file.

These texts are published. Name the activity and the date, never a model, an agent type or a tool, and never a run-internal path such as one under `.reimagine/`. Type no attribution trailer of your own, and keep one the host's attribution setting adds, even where it names a model or tool. Write a bare `@token` in backticks. Write each section from the record's facts, not from a subagent's claim; check a claim before you repeat it. A section with nothing to say holds the word "none".

## Pull request body

Write the body to the run's body file in the record: `pr-body.md`, or `pr-body-<slug>.md` for an additional repository, each with the suffix `-run<n>` from run 2 on (`record.md`, Files). On a continued branch whose pull request this loop opened, the body covers every input of every run of the record. On a host other than `github`, the body always covers every input of every run of the record, since the loop never edits a description there and the user pastes the whole of it. It has these sections, in this order:

```
## What changed
<per input: the ticket, file or description, "complete" or "partial", what changed, and what is left>
<deferred items: each with its reason>

## Drift corrections
<where a ticket and the code disagreed, and what the change follows>

## Decisions for the reviewer
<design choices; options rejected and why; behavior a reader could take for a bug>
<on a continued branch: this branch carries <n> commits from before the run; they were reviewed as part of this run's diff, and they are listed here>

## Checks not run
<each check not run, with the reason; each check deferred to CI, by job name; each check failing at baseline, with the evidence>

## Related pull requests
<"none" in a single-repository run; "pending" first in a multi-repository run, then the sibling links>

## Closes
<one line per ticket>
```

In a multi-repository run on a host other than `github`, Related pull requests says the links between the pull requests are added by hand.

On an Azure DevOps remote the description is capped at 4,000 characters, so the body always takes the short form, with nothing measured: `## Related pull requests`, `## Closes`, and last the line "Details are in the first comment." Only `## Closes` grows with the inputs, one line per ticket. Write the full body, with every section, to `<record>/comment-<n>.md`, numbered as `record.md` says, for the user to post as the pull request's first comment.

Closing rules:

- Write `Closes <ref>` only when every acceptance criterion of the ticket is confirmed met. Otherwise write `Refs <ref>`.
- One line per ticket.
- A file input and a text input get no closing line.
- Across repositories only the pull request in the ticket's own repository closes it. Every other pull request cites it as `Refs <owner>/<repo>#<n>`.
- On `github` write an Azure DevOps ticket as `Refs AB#<n>`. On an Azure DevOps remote write it as `Refs [<type> <n>](https://dev.azure.com/<org>/<project>/_workitems/edit/<n>)`. `<type>` is the work item's `System.WorkItemType` from the read the reading step made, else `Work item`. `<project>` is its `System.TeamProject` from that read, else the remote's project, with each space written `%20`. `<org>` is the remote's organization (SKILL.md, Reading the request). On any other host write `Refs AB#<n>`.
- Write a Salesforce ticket as `Refs` and the case number. No Azure DevOps or Salesforce line closes anything.
- A `Refs` line does not attach the work item to the pull request. The `prepared` report asks the user to link the work items with the host's own tooling.

## Continued pull request comment

Use this when the branch has one open pull request: after the body edit when this loop opened the pull request, and alone when it did not, since a body this loop did not write is never edited. The comment covers this run's work. Write it to `comment-<n>.md`, numbered as `record.md` says, with the sections of the body template above, with `## Closes` replaced by:

```
## Issues
<ref>: complete
<ref>: partial. <what is left>
```

One line per ticket. End the comment with the sentence "The pull request's own body decides what merging it closes."

## Ticket comment

Write one comment for each ticket this run took up to `ticket-<id-slug>.md` (`ticket-<id-slug>-run<n>.md` from run 2 on):

```
Status from the loop run on <branch>: <complete | partial | blocked>

Pull request: <link>
<sibling links, one per line, in a multi-repository run>

Criteria:
- <criterion>: <met | not met | not confirmed>. <evidence>

Not done:
- <item, or "none">

Deferred:
- <item with its reason, or "none">
```

- State "partial" plainly when it is partial.
- Cite evidence for every criterion: a check, a test name, a commit or a line of output.
- Mark a criterion "not confirmed" when you did not see it met yourself.
- Name no run-internal path, no model, no agent and no tool.

Return to the step that sent you here.
