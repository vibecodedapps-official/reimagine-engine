# lint.sh: static checks for the audit plugin files.
#
# Usage: sh tests/audit/lint.sh [root]
#
# root defaults to $LINT_ROOT, else plugins/audit in the repository that holds this
# script. Use it to lint a copy, for example a copy of the plugin with Edit added to
# an agent's tools, which must fail.
#
# File list: inside a git work tree, `git ls-files --cached --others
# --exclude-standard` run from root (tracked files plus new files that are not
# ignored, so files a change adds count before they are staged), keeping only files
# that exist. Outside a git work tree, every file under root except .git/.
#
# Checks:
# - commands/run.md, resume.md, act.md, handoff.md exist; every commands/*.md has
#   frontmatter keys description, argument-hint, allowed-tools; no commands/*.md file
#   holds the variable inside double quotes, as "$ARGUMENTS" (alone on a line or
#   anywhere), which would make the user's whole request one token.
# - agents/digester.md, mapper.md, auditor.md, adversary.md, merger.md exist; every
#   agents/*.md has frontmatter keys name (equal to the file name), description,
#   model, tools; every tools entry (YAML list, comma string, or [flow list]) is one
#   of Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write; and no Edit or NotebookEdit token appears
#   anywhere in the file.
# - skills/audit/SKILL.md has frontmatter keys name and description, and the
#   description names the phrase "reimagine audit"; it names each of the nine stage
#   files and skills/audit/resume.md by path, and every stages/*.md path it mentions
#   exists under skills/audit/.
# - skills/audit/handoff.md, skills/audit/live.md, skills/audit/work-items.md, and
#   skills/audit/resume.md exist.
# - Every scripts/<name>.sh path that a file under skills/, commands/, or agents/
#   mentions exists under scripts/.
# - .claude-plugin/plugin.json parses as JSON (node, else python3, else skipped with
#   a note). The catalog that lists the plugin is checked by tools/lint.mjs.
# - No file under .claude-plugin/, commands/, skills/, agents/, or README.md names a
#   design document of the repository (docs/requirements.md, architecture.md,
#   build-plan.md, decisions.md, acceptance.md): a plugin directory holds only what a
#   user installs.
# - No file under agents/, skills/, commands/ mentions `advisor`, except a line that
#   forbids it: one matching (no|never|not)( use)?( the)? `?advisor, any case, such as
#   "no advisor", "never the `advisor`", or "do not use the advisor".
# - Every gh read in a file under agents/, skills/, or commands/ names its host. In a
#   backtick span, a `gh pr <sub>` or `gh issue <sub>` command with at least one
#   argument after <sub> must pass -R or --repo a <host>/<owner>/<repo> value, attached
#   or separated, or an argument that starts with https:// or http:// or is <url>; a
#   `gh api` command with at least one argument must pass the option --hostname with
#   a value, as `--hostname <host>` or `--hostname=<host>`; the text inside another
#   argument, such as `q=--hostname`, does not count. A command may
#   start anywhere in the span (after a blank, `;`, `|`, `&`, or `(`) and ends at the
#   next `;`, `|`, `&`, or `)`. A single-quoted argument with no blank, `;`, `|`, `&`,
#   or `)` in it counts without its quotes; other single-quoted text is ignored. Without
#   a host, gh uses its default host, which can differ from the bundle's. A span with no
#   argument, such as "`gh api` calls" or "`gh issue view` has no parent field", is
#   prose and does not count, nor does an argument that starts with `*`, as in an
#   allowed-tools pattern. Not checked: a span that runs across lines, and lines inside
#   ``` fenced code blocks. A self-test runs the check on fixed sample lines first and
#   fails when its result differs from the expected one; an awk failure also fails.
# - sha256sum lines, including fenced lines, under skills/audit/ (except scripts/)
#   also name shasum; outside ``` fences, patch git diff spans with a three-dot
#   range under skills/audit/ (except scripts/) and agents/ pass --no-ext-diff,
#   excluding --numstat and --name-only. Fixed sample self-tests run first; awk
#   failure fails each check.
# - The converged item shape, the ``` fenced block whose first line is
#   `## C<n>: <title>`, appears in agents/merger.md and in
#   skills/audit/stages/7-converge.md, and the two blocks are the same after leading
#   blanks and CRs are removed. The merger reads only its own file and its prompt, so
#   the shape the stage 7 check needs must be in merger.md.
# - agents/merger.md has the tools Read, Grep and Write and no other, in any order, and
#   names its paging rule ("Read pages of at most 600 lines", "A page the tool refuses
#   is read again"), the anchored Grep pattern `^## <id>$`, the gap check ("with no
#   gap") and `status: failed at <file>:<line>`, which skills/audit/common.md also
#   names. skills/audit/stages/7-converge.md names
#   awk 'END { print NR }', and steps 6, 7.3 and 7.4, the three merger prompts, each
#   say "line count".
# - The command list in hard rule 2 of skills/audit/common.md and in Boundaries item 2
#   of agents/auditor.md, adversary.md, mapper.md and digester.md, read as one line,
#   names `git rev-parse`, `git merge-base`, `git ls-tree`, `git cat-file` with `-t`,
#   `-s` or `-p`, and `git branch --list`; all but the digester's also name `cut` and
#   `uniq`, and bar `sort -o`, `--output` or `--compress-program` and `uniq` with an
#   output file operand.
# - The default rank in skills/audit/stages/1-orient.md lists `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`,
#   `README.md`, `docs/`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/skills/` and `REVIEW.md` in that
#   order, and says `REVIEW.md` is read at the pinned base with `git show <base>:<path>`;
#   skills/audit/stages/9-act.md names the two directories and `REVIEW.md` at the base
#   among the sources of the required checks; it and skills/audit/common.md name the
#   rules in `.claude/rules/` that apply to a file, the skills in `.claude/skills/` and
#   the `REVIEW.md` copies the brief records at the base among the instruction files
#   read before a change; each file is read as one line.
# - skills/audit/common.md says every agent reports and labels a finding as if
#   `REVIEW.md`'s severity calibration and do-not-report rules were absent, since the
#   report applies them and counts what each skips.
# - skills/audit/SKILL.md allowed-tools pre-approves `git ls-tree`, `git cat-file` and
#   `git branch --list`, each also in its `git -C *` form; the bare `git cat-file` only
#   with `-t`, `-s` or `-p`, since `--textconv` and `--filters` run configured programs.
# - skills/audit/stages/1-orient.md, read as one line, spreads a claim that names no
#   file across the bundle's groups in turn, caps a group at 80 such claims, and has
#   the brief's Claims section record each scope's claim count and each move.
# - skills/audit/resume.md keeps a finished pass1/ or pass2/ file when stage 4 or 5 is
#   the first rerun stage because its entry is missing or running, and stages 4 and 5
#   launch no agent for a scope whose file resume kept; each file is read as one line.
# - Each of the five agents has a `## Hard rules, restated` section before `## Steps`
#   that names no advisor or second-opinion tool, its scratch folder and
#   `status: complete`, and, but for the merger, `mkdir -p`, a heredoc and a command
#   that waits on input; skills/audit/common.md hard rule 2 allows `mkdir -p` of the
#   agent's own scratch folder and bars an inline program or a heredoc; SKILL.md says a
#   late completion notification changes nothing.
# - skills/audit/stages/9-act.md shows an item's defect before the edit, logs it as
#   `demonstrate`, lists that action, and carries the before and after results into the
#   commit body; step 7 reruns each `demonstrate` command after the change and logs its
#   result as `demonstrate`; the file is read as one line.
#
# Exit 0 when every check passes. Otherwise print one line per failure and exit 1.
