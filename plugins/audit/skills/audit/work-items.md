# Work-items format

`work-items.jsonl` is the audit's plan for changes to tickets and pull requests, written
by stage 8 into the run directory. It is a plan, never an action: the audit applies none
of it, and neither does `/audit:act`. A person, or a forge adapter, applies it. A ticket
that does not exist yet is named by a placeholder, so a later operation can refer to it.

This file is the single home of the format. `stages/8-report.md` and
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/work-items.sh` follow it.

## Layout

One JSON object per line, with no blank line: a blank line is an error. The ids run
`W1`, `W2`, ... in line order, with no gap. Every object has:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `run` | the run id, as in the report's heading `# audit report: <run-id>` |
| `id` | `W<n>`, `<n>` the line's position |
| `op` | one of the operations below |
| `target` | the forge id a person or adapter acts on (see "Targets and placeholders") |
| `items` | a non-empty array of report item ids (`C<n>`), claim references (`claim <n>`), or ids of other operations (`W<n>`, see "Supporting operations") |
| `reason` | why, in one or two sentences |

`target_url` is optional, a string holding the forge URL when one is known (`url` from
the forge data or the export). The file carries no report revision: it is validated
before the report is hashed, and a resume that writes a new report supersedes the file
with it.

## Operations

| `op` | Fields | `target` |
|---|---|---|
| `create` | `key`, `type`, `title`, `description`, optional `fields` (object), optional `links` (array of `{ "type", "to" }`) | `$new:<key>`, its own key |
| `set_field` | `field`, `value` | forge id or `$new:<key>` |
| `set_state` | `value` | forge id or `$new:<key>` |
| `set_fields` | `fields`, a non-empty object with no null value | forge id or `$new:<key>` |
| `add_link` | `link_type`, `to` (forge id or `$new:<key>`) | forge id or `$new:<key>` |
| `remove_link` | `link_type`, `to` (forge id) | forge id |
| `add_comment` | `text`, optional `mentions` | forge id or `$new:<key>`, ticket or pull request |
| `update_comment` | `comment_id`, `text`, optional `mentions` | forge id, ticket or pull request |
| `set_description` | `text`, optional `mentions` | forge id or `$new:<key>` |
| `set_acceptance_criteria` | `text`, optional `mentions` | forge id or `$new:<key>` |
| `set_pr_description` | `text`, optional `mentions` | pull request forge id |

String fields are non-empty strings. `set_field`'s `value` is any JSON value but null,
so a number or a list can be set. The keys of `fields`, and `set_field`'s `field`, are
the forge's own field names as the forge or its export writes them; the adapter maps
them to its API, including fields that differ by work item type. `set_fields` sets
several fields in one operation by the same names. An operation takes no key beyond the
common keys and its own fields.

`text` on `set_description`, `set_pr_description`, `set_acceptance_criteria`,
`add_comment` and `update_comment` is the complete content the forge should hold after
the operation, drafted by stage 8 from the report and written for its reader as
`SKILL.md`, What leaves the run, says, with the permitted `{mention:<key>}`
placeholders and no forge markup. It holds no `C<n>`, `claim <n>` or `W<n>`; the ids
stay in `items` and `reason`. An instruction to compose the text
at apply time ("replace this with the recorded decision") does not meet this contract;
nothing renders it.

## Mentions

`mentions` is optional on each operation with `text`. It is an array of
`{ "name", "placeholder" }`, both non-empty strings, with no other key. A placeholder is
`{mention:<key>}`, where `<key>` is letters, digits, `.`, `_` or `-`. Placeholders are
unique in the operation, and each appears in `text`; every `{mention:...}` in `text` has
an entry. The adapter renders each in the forge's own markup, so `text` holds none.

## Supporting operations

`items` may name a `W<n>`, for an operation that exists only because another needs it,
such as a field the forge requires before a state change. The reference may point
forward: the supporting operation comes first. An operation never names itself. Every
operation reaches a `C<n>` or a `claim <n>`, directly or through the `W<n>` it names, so
a cycle of operations with no report item or claim is an error.

## Targets and placeholders

- A forge id is `owner/repo#n` for GitHub, or the export's `id` for an exported ticket
  or pull request.
- `$new:<key>` is a placeholder for the ticket a `create` makes. `create` keys are
  unique, and a `create` line's `target` is `$new:<its key>`.
- Every other `$new:<key>`, in `target`, `to` or `links[].to`, names a `create` on a
  line above it. A placeholder never refers forward.
- `set_pr_description`, `update_comment` and `remove_link` (its `target` and `to`) take
  forge ids, never placeholders.
- Text in `title`, `description`, `text`, `value` and `reason` names no model, agent or
  tool (`common.md`, "Hard rules"). `title`, `description`, `text` and `value` are what
  the forge holds and follow `SKILL.md`, What leaves the run; `reason` is the run's
  record and may name ids.

## Validator

```
sh ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/work-items.sh check <file> <report body> <claims.md>
```

The report body is the report without its revision line, as stage 8 holds it in
`report.body.tmp` before hashing. With `jq`, the script reads every line first, then
checks that:

- every line parses as one JSON object, and none is blank;
- the common keys and the operation's fields are present with the right types, and no
  other key is (an unknown operation reports only `unknown op`);
- ids run `W1` upward with no gap;
- every placeholder rule above holds, the forge-id-only targets included;
- `fields` of `set_fields` is a non-empty object with no null value;
- every mentions rule above holds;
- `run` equals the run id in the body's first `# ` heading, `# audit report: <run-id>`;
- every `C<n>` in `items` is an item heading `#### C<n>: ` in the body;
- every `claim <n>` in `items` is a numbered claim line of `claims.md`, one starting
  `<n>. [claim:`;
- every `W<n>` in `items` names another operation in the file;
- every operation reaches a `C<n>` or a claim, directly or through the `W<n>` it names.

It prints `work-items: ok` and exits 0, or prints one line per error,
`work-items <file>:<line>: <message>`, and exits 1. A body without the heading gives the
one line `work-items <body>:<line>: no '# audit report: <run-id>' heading` and exit 1.
It exits 2 on a usage error or an unreadable file, and with `work-items: jq not found`
on stderr when `jq` is missing.

## What stage 8 does with the result

Stage 8 runs the validator on `report.body.tmp`, before the report is hashed, and puts
the result in the report's Coverage section:

- exit 0: Coverage says `work-items: ok`;
- exit 1: the file is kept, Coverage lists the error lines, and the file is marked not
  ready for an adapter. The report is not changed to fit the file;
- exit 2: the file is kept, and Coverage says it was not validated, with the script's
  message.

`/audit:act` applies none of these operations. They are drafts, like the report's
work-item fixes.
