description: "Write a typed handoff from a build session, for an audit to read as claims, optionally applying a claims verdicts file and listing memory files to reconcile. A new audit starts with /audit:run, which also answers to the prose request \"reimagine audit ...\"."

You forward this request to the audit skill. Take the steps below in order, and write no file in any of them; the skill writes the handoff.

1. Read the words between the markers below. They are what the user typed after the command.

<user-text>
$ARGUMENTS
</user-text>

   - Split the words into tokens at spaces. Text the user put in quotes stays one token.
   - Every token is a flag or a flag's value. The flags are `--out`, `--verdicts` and
     `--memory`, each at most once, each with one value: the next token, which does not start
     with `--`. Reject any other flag or token, a repeated flag and a missing value.
   - `--out` is the path the handoff is written to. Without it, out is `none`, and the skill
     picks the path.
   - `--verdicts` is the path of a claims verdicts file. Without it, verdicts is `none`.
   - `--memory` is the directory of the build session's memory files. It needs `--verdicts`:
     without that flag, reject with `audit: --memory needs --verdicts`. Without `--memory`,
     memory is `none`.

2. Validate cheaply with the Read tool. Relative paths are relative to the session's directory.
   - The `--out` path does not exist yet, as a file or a directory, so no handoff is ever
     overwritten.
   - The `--verdicts` file exists.
   - The `--memory` path exists and is a directory.

   When a rule of step 1 or step 2 fails, reject with one short line `audit: <reason>` that
   names the token or path, such as `audit: --out already exists: <path>` or
   `audit: --verdicts file not found: <path>`. Then run nothing else and do not load the skill.
   Check nothing more here: the skill checks where the handoff may go and what the verdicts say.

3. Build the block below. Every key not named in this step keeps the value shown.

```
command: handoff
request: none
manifest: none
inputs: none
run-id: none
items: none
per-item: false
from: none
live: none
out: none | <path>
verdicts: none | <file>
memory: none | <dir>
```

   Show the user a short summary in plain words, not the block: the output path, the verdicts
   file and the memory directory, each only when given.

4. Invoke the Skill tool with skill `audit:audit` and that block as the args, then follow the
   skill. Do not gather the record or write the handoff before the skill says how.
