# Live check results

A live check is a query or command that only a live system or another environment can
answer. The audit never runs one (`common.md`, "Hard rules": live data only from a
user-supplied `--live` file). The report lists each needed check; the user runs the
approved ones and returns the results with `/audit:resume <run-id> --live <file>`. This
file is the single home of the report's Live checks blocks, the `--live` file format,
its validator, the imports and the files derived from them, and the rules that turn a
result into a finding's label or a claim's verdict. The validator and the bookkeeping
are `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/live.sh`, which follows this file. The resume
procedure that calls it is `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/audit/resume.md`.

A finding result reruns stages 6 to 8, so the second opinion, the late adversary and the
merger review it; a result that answers only claims reruns stages 7 and 8. Resume refuses
an import once a bundle's recorded head or base stops matching, and when the rerun it
would need starts at stage 5 or before. A plugin update between the report and the
results does not stop it. With `--live`, a recorded `plugin_version` other than the
current one does not invalidate stage 1 when every other input of stage 1 is unchanged.

## Ids

A live entry names one of:

- a finding id that has a Live checks block: `<scope>-F<n>`, `<scope>-P<n>` or
  `<scope>-T<n>` from `ledger/5.md` (a merged group's id reads `g1+g2-F3`), a
  second-opinion addition `X<n>`, or a late addition `L<n>`;
- `claim <n>`, an environment claim of `claims.md`: a verified statement whose check is
  tagged `env: <name>; <check>` (`common.md`, "Claim kinds").

It never names `C<n>`: stage 7 keeps a `C<n>` stable only for the same ledger files, and
a rerun can number the items differently. Stage 5 never reruns under `--live`, so the
`ledger/5.md` ids hold for the life of the imports. A rerun of stage 6 or 7 numbers
`X<n>` and `L<n>` again, so a result for one of those keeps a copy of its finding (see
"Carried findings").

## The report's Live checks blocks

Report section 9 holds one block per live check, every value on one whole line. A block
starts at a heading `#### live <finding id>` or `#### live claim <n>` and runs to the
next line that starts with one or more `#` and a space:

```
#### live <finding id> | live claim <n>
- item: C<n> | claim <n>
- query: <the query or command, exactly as the check states it>
- where: <where it runs>                  (finding)
- env: <name>                             (env claim)
- results: <what each result changes>     (finding)
- status: not run: not approved | run, approved by <who> at <time>: <result>; derived: <derived>; <reviewed | under review: <what it lacks>>
```

For a finding, `where` and `results` are its own `live check` field split at its
semicolons. For an environment claim, `env` stands in place of `where` and `results`,
and `query` is the check part of the verified entry after its `env: <name>; ` tag. The
`#### live ` headings never match the `#### C<n>: ` item headings the work-items
validator reads. `status` reads `not run: not approved` until a result is imported; then
it gives the approver and time from the result, the result itself, what was derived from
it ("Derivation"), and `reviewed`, or `under review: <what it lacks>` while the live
review has not completed (the gate in `stages/7-converge.md`). A result kept as a file is
shown as `in live/results-<k>/<line>.txt, sha256:<hex>`, the copy and its hash from
`SHA256SUMS`.

`live.sh check` reads only the `- query:` and `- env:` lines of each block, the first of
each, with trailing spaces removed.

## The --live file

```
---
reimagine-live: 1
run: <run id>
report: sha256:<hex>
---

## <finding id> | claim <n>
- query: <the query or command run>
- env: <name>                     (a claim entry only, the environment it ran against)
- where: <where it ran>
- result: <the result, one line>   (or result_file: <path>, below)
- approved_by: <the person who approved the access>
- approved_at: <time, starting YYYY-MM-DD>
```

- `run` is the report's run id, from its heading `# audit report: <run-id>`, and
  `report` is its revision, `sha256:<hex>` from the first line, so a result answers one
  report.
- The frontmatter opens on line 1 and closes with `---`, and holds its three keys once
  each. Beyond the lines shown and blank lines, no key or line is accepted.
- Every value is one line with no tab, of any length and not empty. Lines end in LF or
  CRLF; a leading byte order mark is ignored.
- At least one entry, each id once. An entry's keys appear once each, in the order
  shown. `env` is required on a claim entry and refused on a finding entry.
- `query` is the check as it ran. `where` is free text naming the place. For a claim the
  derivation reads `env`, not `where`.
- A result of more than one line, such as the rows a query returns, goes in a file:
  `- result_file: <path>` in place of `- result:`, at the same position. An entry has
  exactly one of the two. The path is relative to the `--live` file's directory and
  stays under it: not absolute, no drive letter, no `..` component. The test is on the
  path as written: a symlink in that directory is followed, and a file beside the
  `--live` file, such as an `.env`, passes. Its copy goes to the second opinion, the
  late adversary and the report, so read a `--live` file someone else wrote before
  importing it, and keep it in a directory that holds only its results. Leading spaces
  of the path are ignored. The file is kept byte for byte, so it may hold any text; it
  is not empty.

## What check validates

`sh "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/live.sh" check <file> <report.md>` prints `live: ok` and
exits 0, or prints one line per error, `live <file>:<line>: <message>`, in line order, on
stdout and exits 1. It exits 2 with one line `live: <what failed>` on stderr on a usage
error, an unreadable file or report, no `sha256sum` and no `shasum`, or a report without
its first line `revision: sha256:<hex>` or its heading `# audit report: <run-id>`. It
checks that the SHA-256 of every byte after the report's first line (`tail -n +2`, as
stage 8 computes it) equals the revision, and judges nothing else when it does not, since
an edited body cannot pass under its revision; that the frontmatter and each entry follow
"The --live file"; that each heading names a `#### live <id>` block of the report; that
the entry's `query` equals the block's `query` exactly, trailing spaces removed, since the
result of another query settles nothing; and that a claim entry's `env` equals the block's
`env` exactly. It opens a `result_file` only when nothing else is wrong, so the lines stay
in line order.

## Imports and their state

Everything lives under `<run dir>/live/`. The results files are the record of what was
imported; there is no separate log, so no gap can open between a file and its record.

- `live/results-<k>.md` is an import once it exists under that name. `<k>` is one more
  than the highest `<k>` present, compared as a number (`results-10.md` follows
  `results-9.md`). Results files are never moved or deleted, so a committed `<k>` is
  never reused, and an approval's `source`, `live/results-<k>.md:<line>` (the line of the
  entry's `## ` heading), names one file for the life of the run. A
  `live/results-<k>.md.pending` was never committed and has no approval: nothing reads
  it, `import` and `retire` remove it, and its number may be taken again.
- `live/results-<k>/` holds the import's result copies when an entry has a
  `result_file`: `<line>.txt` is the copy for the entry whose `## ` heading is at
  `<line>`, so the copy for source `live/results-<k>.md:<line>` is
  `live/results-<k>/<line>.txt`. `SHA256SUMS` lists each copy as `<hex>  <line>.txt`, in
  line order, hashed from the copy. The kept `.md` still names the user's path; the copy
  is the record. The directory is committed with its `.md`: a
  `live/results-<k>.pending/` directory, or a `live/results-<k>/` without its
  `live/results-<k>.md`, was never committed, and `import` and `retire` remove it. Like
  the results files, the copies are never moved, changed or deleted.
- `live/retired.md` is append-only: one line `<k> retired <time>: <reason>` per import
  whose findings or claims a rerun replaced, `<k>` a number without a leading zero. An
  import is **active** when it exists and is not retired. Any other line in the file
  makes every mode that reads it exit 1 with
  `live: live/retired.md:<line>: not a retirement record`.
- `live/findings.md` (finding ids), `live/claims.md` (`claim <n>` ids) and
  `live/carried/<id>.md` are state built from the active imports; none is a source of
  truth. A derived file is `## <id>` sections in winner order (below), LF only, every
  line ending in LF, the last included, with no blank line. A section is `## <id>`,
  `- source: <source>`, `- earlier: <source>, <source> | none`, then one or more
  derivation lines, none empty or starting `## `. A section runs to the line before the
  next `## ` line or the end of the file, so sections concatenate byte for byte. A
  derived file is never written empty: with no section it is removed.
- A malformed derived file makes `active` and `assemble` exit 1, since it is state. Each
  error is one line, in line order, `findings.md` before `claims.md`:
  `live: live/<name>.md:<line>: <message>; delete the file to rebuild it`, where
  `<message>` is one of `carriage return`, `empty line`, `no final newline`,
  `line before the first section`, `section '<id>' twice`,
  `line 2 of a section must be '- source: <source>'`,
  `line 3 of a section must be '- earlier: <sources>'`, or `no derivation lines` (at the
  section's heading, when the section ends). Deleting the file is the repair: the next
  reconcile builds it again from the imports.
- The **winner** of an id is its entry in the active import with the highest `<k>`; the
  `- earlier:` line lists the entries of the lower `<k>`, in increasing order. Winner
  order is the order of each id's first appearance across the active imports, in `<k>`
  then line order. A winner is `kept` when the derived file holds a section for the id
  with the same `- source:` line, `changed` when the section names another source, and
  `new` when there is no section or no file.

## Carried findings

A rerun of stage 6 or 7 numbers `X<n>` and `L<n>` again, so an id with a result could
name another finding afterwards. A result for `X<n>` or `L<n>` therefore carries the
finding in `live/carried/<id>.md`, written once and never changed: the first reconcile
that meets an active result for the id runs `live.sh carry`, which copies the finding's
block verbatim from the ledger file that holds it (`ledger/6.md` for `X<n>`,
`ledger/7.md` for `L<n>`). Later results for the same id use that file, since after the
rerun the ledger holds only a position or a verdict for the id. When the file is missing
and the ledger holds no block for the id, `carry` exits 1 and resume stops with its line.

The id is reserved. On the rerun, stage 6 numbers its additions after the highest
carried `X<n>`, and the late adversary after the highest carried `L<n>`. A carried
finding goes through the live review like any other: stage 6 gives it a position, the
late adversary a verdict, and the merger absorbs it. Retiring the imports moves
`live/carried/` away with the derived files, since the rerun that retires them may
number those ids again.

## The modes

The orchestrator runs each mode as `sh "<resolved absolute path of live.sh>" <mode> ...`
and never edits anything under `live/` itself. Every mode runs under `LC_ALL=C`, so
listings and sorting are byte order. A usage error, an unreadable input or a failed
operation (`cp`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `rm`, a temp file write, `jq`) exits 2 with one line
`live: <what failed>` on stderr. Exit 1 is a validation or state error the mode names,
one `live: <message>` line each on stdout, leaving the committed imports,
`live/retired.md`, the carried files, the derived files and `stages.json` unchanged. The
only writes an exit 1 may leave are `import`'s: the uncommitted files and directories it
removed, and a `live/` it created, empty. `assemble` and `carry` write nothing on exit 1.
Every file is written through a temp file in the target's directory and an `mv`. Resume
stops with the script's lines on any nonzero exit, before it supersedes or reruns
anything; running resume again completes the work.

- `import <file> <report.md> <run dir>`. Needs `jq`, checked before anything is written
  (`live: jq not found`, exit 2), since the reconcile that follows runs `active`; a
  missing run directory is exit 2 too. It removes what an interrupted import left
  uncommitted (`live/results-*.md.pending` and the result directories above); checks
  `live/retired.md`, the derived files and the result copies of the active imports, as
  `active` does, exiting 1 with those lines before it writes anything else; copies the
  file to `live/results-<k>.md.pending`, creating `live/` when missing; and runs the
  `check` logic on the copy, its lines naming `<file>` as given and each `result_file`
  resolved against `<file>`'s directory. On exit 1 it removes the copy and prints the
  lines. On success, when an entry has a `result_file`, it copies each file to
  `live/results-<k>.pending/<line>.txt`, tests each copy again (a file emptied since the
  check gives `result_file '<path>' is empty` and exit 1, both pending copies removed),
  writes `SHA256SUMS` from the copies and moves the directory to `live/results-<k>/`.
  Then it moves the file to `live/results-<k>.md` and prints
  `live: imported live/results-<k>.md`. That last move is the commit point, and the
  bytes validated are the bytes kept.
- `active <run dir>`. Read only; prints nothing when `live/` is missing. Tab-separated
  lines, in this order:
  - `approve<TAB><source><TAB><id><TAB><approved_by><TAB><approved_at>` for each entry of
    each active import, in `<k>` then line order, whose source is not the `source` of an
    `approvals` entry of kind `live` in `stages.json` (read with `jq`; a missing
    `stages.json` counts as no approvals, and a `jq` failure on one that exists is
    exit 2);
  - `carry<TAB><id><TAB>ledger/<6|7>.md` for each winning `X<n>` or `L<n>` without a
    `live/carried/<id>.md`, in winner order;
  - `winner<TAB><id><TAB><source><TAB><earlier><TAB><kept|new|changed>` for each id in
    winner order, `<earlier>` being the lower-`<k>` sources, `, `-separated, or `none`.
  A malformed `live/retired.md` or derived file is exit 1. So is a result copy that
  does not hold up, for each active import with a `result_file` entry: a missing
  `SHA256SUMS`, one that does not list exactly `<line>.txt` for each such entry in line
  order, or a copy that is missing or does not match it.
  `assemble` and `import` run the same checks first, so a retried `--live` never commits
  another import over broken state. A retired import is not checked. The way out is a
  resume with `--from 5` or lower, which retires the imports, then importing the results
  again.
- `carry <run dir> <id>`. `<id>` is `X<n>` or `L<n>`; anything else is a usage error,
  exit 2. It cuts the block that starts at the line beginning `### <id>: ` in
  `ledger/6.md` (`X`) or `ledger/7.md` (`L`) and runs to the next `## ` line or
  `### <word>: ` line (`### ` subheadings without a colon stay inside). The start line
  and the end lines count only outside a code fence, a line whose text after leading
  spaces and tabs starts with three backticks opening or closing one, as the ledger reads
  it. A block that reaches the end of the file inside an open fence is no block, as the
  ledger leaves it out. The command writes the block to
  `live/carried/<id>.md`, creating `live/carried/`. Exit 1, writing nothing, when that
  file exists or the ledger holds no such block.
- `assemble <run dir> <entries dir>`. Reads the orchestrator's new and changed entries,
  one `*.md` file each (a missing directory holds none). An entry is LF only: a first
  line `## <id>`, then one or more lines, none empty or starting `## `, `- source:` or
  `- earlier:`; a missing final LF is added when it is written. It exits 1 and writes
  nothing when an entry breaks that form, names an id that is not a new or changed
  winner or that another entry names too, or when a new or changed winner has no entry
  or an `X<n>` or `L<n>` winner has no carried file.
  Otherwise it builds `live/findings.md` and `live/claims.md`, each in winner order: a
  `kept` id's section copied byte for byte from the current file; a new or changed id's
  written as `## <id>`, the winner's `- source:` and `- earlier:` lines, then the entry's
  lines. A current section whose id wins nothing is dropped. A file is written only when
  its bytes change and removed when it has no section. It prints
  `live: <kept|wrote|removed|absent> live/findings.md`, then the same for
  `live/claims.md`, then removes `<entries dir>`. After a failure between the two files,
  the next `active` reports the written file's ids as `kept` and the rest unchanged, so a
  rerun finishes the job.
- `retire <run dir> <dest dir> <reason>`. The reason is one non-empty line (else exit
  2). It first reads and checks `live/retired.md`, exiting 1 with nothing changed on a
  malformed line; removes what an import left uncommitted, as `import` does; creates
  `<dest dir>` when there is something to move (exit 2 when a name already exists
  there); appends `<k> retired <time>: <reason>` (time from
  `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`) to `live/retired.md` for each active import, in `<k>`
  order, through a temp copy and an `mv`; then moves `live/findings.md`,
  `live/claims.md` and `live/carried/`, those present, into `<dest dir>`. The results
  files and `live/retired.md` stay, so every approval's source still resolves. It
  prints `live: retired <k>` per import, then `live: moved live/<name>` per move. Each
  step is idempotent: a rerun after a failure appends nothing for an import already
  retired and moves what is left, possibly into the next `superseded/<k>/live/`, so
  every moved file stays under `superseded/`.

## Reconciling

Resume reconciles on every invocation, with or without `--live`, when `live/` exists
and the rerun it computes starts at stage 6 or later. The order is fixed, so no entry
lists its own source, a newer result never loses to an older one, a claim-only import
leaves `live/findings.md` byte for byte as it was, and a derived file deleted by hand is
built again from the imports:

1. `live.sh active <run dir>`.
2. Record each `approve` line in `stages.json` `approvals`: kind `live`, target the id,
   decision `approved`, time `approved_at`, plus `by` (the approver) and `source`. The
   script lists only sources not yet recorded, so a repeat records nothing.
3. `live.sh carry <run dir> <id>` for each `carry` line.
4. Remove `<run dir>/tmp/live-entries/` if present. For each `new` or `changed` winner,
   derive its entry from the winning result ("Derivation") and write it to a file
   there, named by the winner's position (`1.md`, `2.md`, ... in winner order), holding
   `## <id>` and the derivation lines. A `kept` winner gets none.
5. `live.sh assemble <run dir> <run dir>/tmp/live-entries`.

The orchestrator runs no query itself.

## Derivation

The orchestrator derives each entry from the finding's own `live check` field, which
says what each result changes. The validator has already matched the query and, for a
claim, the environment. The result is the entry's `result` line, or for a `result_file`
entry the whole copy `live/results-<k>/<line>.txt`, read in full (in slices when it is
large), never the user's original file.

- A finding where exactly one stated outcome matches the result: a result that shows the
  defect gives `verified fact` at the severity that outcome names, else the finding's
  own; one that shows it absent gives `dropped`. The derivation is one line, such as
  `verified fact, high: <why the result shows it>` or `dropped: <why>`.
- A finding where no stated outcome or several match, or `where` names another place
  than the check: `unchanged: no stated outcome matches` (or `unchanged: ran elsewhere`).
- An environment claim: a result that shows the stated result gives `true, reproduced`;
  one that contradicts it gives `false, contradicted`; anything else gives
  `not verified, not reproduced` with the reason.
- Every finding entry goes to review. A live check exists because the finding is an
  `unverified assumption`, so a conclusive result changes its label, and the gate keeps
  the finding provisional until its live review has completed.

Each entry line cites its basis as `live result, approved by <who> at <time>`, with the
source, and for a `result_file` entry the copy's path `live/results-<k>/<line>.txt`. A
derivation is a proposal for the reviewers, never a verdict.

A copy is reviewer input. The **result copies** of a derived file are the copies of its
sections' `- source:` entries that have one. Each review of a live result gets the
result copies of the derived files it reads, so it judges the result itself, not a
summary: the second opinion (stage 6) those of `live/findings.md`, the late adversary
(stage 7) those of `live/findings.md` and `live/claims.md`. Stage 8 reads them for the
report. The merger does not get them: it merges the positions the reviews gave, and the
derivation lines name each copy. The copies are not hashed as stage inputs: a copy never
changes, `active` checks it against `SHA256SUMS` before any reconcile, and a new result
changes the `- source:` line, which the derived file's hash already covers.
