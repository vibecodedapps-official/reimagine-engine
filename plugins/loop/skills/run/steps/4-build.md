# Steps 3.6 to 6: confirm, set up, build, review, check

Read this file when Step 3 ends with a final plan in a run that is not plan-only: at the start of 3.6 when the plan is to be confirmed ("confirm the plan"), else at the start of 3.7. It holds the implementer snapshots, the implementer brief, and Steps 3.6, 3.7, 4, 5 and 6.

At the start of each step run `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ` and copy its output. Then apply `record.md`, Reuse and resume: a reused step is not run, and its entry stays as it is. Otherwise write the step's `steps.json` entry as `running` with its inputs as `record.md`, steps.json, item 5, lists them (for Step 4 the `git hash-object --no-filters` hash of `plan.md`; for Steps 5 and 6 that hash and `head`), and write it `complete` only after its outputs exist: the step's section of `run.md` and, where the step takes them, the snapshot and patch files. Steps 3.6 and 3.7 belong to Step 3: its entry stays `running` through them, with the `plan.md` hash rewritten after any revision. When Step 3 is reused, they still run (`record.md`, Reuse and resume, item 7) and its entry stays as it is unless a revision gives Step 3 a round. Write it `complete`, with `plan.md` as its output, at the end of 3.7 after setup succeeds. A confirmation or setup outcome that ends the run `blocked` marks the entry `failed`; for `plan-only` and `stopped` leave the entry as it is and let Final report handling in SKILL.md record the terminal state. Every file named here without a directory lives in the record (`record.md`). Every step is capped at three rounds.

## Implementer snapshots

Take a snapshot before every implementer call and every fix call, in the checkout that call edits (the primary checkout, a worktree, or an additional repository). From Step 3.7 on, also take a snapshot before each question (SKILL.md, Questions); its `run.md` line names the question instead of a slice.

1. Write three files in the record: `pre-<n>.status` holds the output of `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all`; `pre-<n>.patch` holds the output of `git diff` (tracked and intent-to-add paths); `pre-<n>.hashes` holds one line per untracked, non-ignored file outside `.reimagine/`, the output of `git hash-object -- <path>` followed by the path. Number `n` as `record.md`, Files, says: one more than the highest in the record, so it is unique across checkouts, calls and runs. Add a line to `run.md` naming `n`, the checkout path and the slice (or the question).
2. A parallel batch (4.2) takes one snapshot per slice before any call of the batch starts.
3. After a call fails, compare the checkout with its snapshot: status, diff and hashes. A call fails when it ends in a tool error or returns past the subagent budget. For a parallel batch compare after every call of the batch has returned, and treat a path as inside the slice when any slice of the batch owns it.
4. A path outside the slice that was clean before the call and is now new or changed is restored: a tracked file with `git checkout -- <path>`, an untracked non-ignored file by deleting it. Log each action in `run.md`.
5. A path that was already dirty or intent-to-add before the call and now differs, or an untracked file whose hash changed, ends the run `blocked`, and the report names the path. Never touch an ignored path or anything under `.reimagine/`.
6. An implementer tool error ends the run `blocked` once the comparison and restore are done. There is no fallback implementer. A call past the subagent budget gets the same comparison and restore and then ends the run `blocked`, naming the subagent budget; it is not a round.

## Implementer brief

Write one brief per slice and pass it as the whole prompt of the implementer. It holds:

1. The slice as `plan.md` states it: the change, the files the slice owns, the acceptance criteria, and the checks that apply to it.
2. Whether the slice runs in parallel with others. A parallel slice runs no checks and says so in its report; a slice that runs alone runs its own checks and reports the results.
3. The instruction file paths to read first (the user's and the repository's, from Step 0.1), and that a rule the host loaded for the slice's files, such as a path-scoped rule under `.claude/rules/`, is binding.
   The `opus` stand-in's review request of Step 5 names the base commit's `REVIEW.md` (`git show <merge-base>:REVIEW.md`, and the same file in each parent directory of a changed file) as review instructions when one exists; a copy the branch adds or changes is not. The `code-review` skill takes no request text and is sent none.
4. The checkout path the implementer edits: the worktree or additional repository path when the slice lives there, else the primary checkout. Every path in the brief is absolute.
5. The line-ending rule. Run `git ls-files --eol` on the slice's existing files. When a file shows an `eol=` attribute, match it. When `text` or `text=auto` applies with no `eol=`, any ending is fine, since git normalizes it. Otherwise match the majority working-tree ending of the file's directory, else of the repository. The implementer never changes the line endings of a file it edits.
6. The scope rule: change nothing outside the slice's files and add nothing the brief does not ask for; report instead of editing anything outside; do not commit, push, install anything or run `gh`; leave intent-to-add marks alone.
7. The reply shape: files changed, checks run with results, and anything it could not do.

After a `drop` answer to the credential question (Step 0.1a), the brief carries the redacted values only, never the dropped text.

## Step 3.6 Plan confirmation

Run this step only when the request says "confirm the plan" and the run is not plan-only. Otherwise go to 3.7.

1. Run the read-only reverification of 3.7.1 now. A revision it needs gets its Step 3 round here, inside the cap of three. When no round is left, end `blocked` and name the unreviewed revision.
2. Print the path of `plan.md` and a short summary: the slices, the files each owns, the acceptance criteria, the risk floor and the checks.
3. Ask the user to reply yes to build, or to describe a change, under the question rules in SKILL.md. Take `date` just before and just after the question; the wait is outside the run budget.
4. A clear yes continues. A reply that means go ahead and nothing else is a yes; a reply that mixes a yes with a change is a change. Before 3.7.2, rerun these Step 0 checks in every repository the run edits: the clean tree (`git status --porcelain` empty and `git diff --cached --quiet` passing), the flagged files, the branch checks, the remote head (`git ls-remote` compared with the head recorded at preflight), and the open pull request check. Anything that changed ends the run `blocked`, naming it.
5. A described change is recorded in the run's section of `inputs.md`, verified the way 1.3 verifies claims, and the risk floor is judged again; the floor never falls. Update `plan.md`. The change gets one more Step 3 round inside the cap. When that round ends with no blocking objection, ask the question again. When no round is left, end `stopped` with the change as the question. A round that ends with a blocking objection and no round left ends `blocked`, as in Step 3.
6. Any other reply ends the run `plan-only`.

## Step 3.7 Execution setup

Run these in order. When 3.6 already ran 3.7.1, start at 3.7.2. On a run with no new work, run only 3.7.2 and 3.7.4 (`record.md`, An existing record, item 8). In a worktree run follow `worktree.md`; with more than one writable repository run 3.7.2 to 3.7.4 once per repository, as `multi-repo.md` says.

1. **3.7.1 Reverify.** When the planning snapshot (Step 0.4) is not the base commit, reverify the plan against the base without changing anything: `git show <base>:<path>` for each file the plan cites and `git diff <snapshot> <base>`. Revise the plan for what moved. A revision gets one Step 3 round inside the cap; with no round left, end `blocked`.
2. **3.7.2 Branch.** A new branch is created with `git switch -c <name> <base commit>`, after confirming the name exists neither locally (`git branch --list <name>`) nor on the remote (`git ls-remote --heads <remote> refs/heads/<name>`). A collision ends `blocked`. A continued branch is switched to; Step 0.2 may already have done it. Then record the merge-base, `git merge-base <remote>/<base> HEAD`, with `<base>` the base branch of Step 0.2, in `run.md`. Every diff review and every changed-lines count in this run uses that merge-base.
3. **3.7.3 Baseline.** Discover the checks (6.1), record them in `run.md`, and run each once on the base, one command at a time under the check budget. The result is the baseline. For a failing check, save the output and the failing test names as the baseline evidence, since 6.3 matches against them.
4. **3.7.4 Dependencies.** When the plan adds a dependency, install it now: after the baseline, after any ask-first rule about dependencies has a clear yes, and before any implementer starts. Run the install command the repository names, under the check budget, and log the manifest and lockfile edits in `run.md`. A refused permission is a denial (SKILL.md), not a missing resource.

Then write Step 3's entry `complete` unless it was reused (see the opening), and go to Step 4, or to Step 6 on a run with no new work.

## Step 4 Build

1. **4.1 Brief.** Write the implementer brief (above) for each open slice of `plan.md`. A slice whose commit is on the branch is not open and is not built again (`record.md`, An existing record).
2. **4.2 Implementers.**
   - Use one Agent call per slice at the implementer model (`models.implementer`, default `sonnet`), passing `model` explicitly and the effort the request sets. Never use a fork.
   - Slices with disjoint files that the order of work marks independent run as parallel Agent calls in one message, and run no checks. Ordered slices run one at a time.
   - Take the snapshot before each call, take `date` before and after each call, and log the model per slice in `run.md`.
   - The subagent budget is 20 minutes per call, or `timeouts.subagent`. A call past it ends the run `blocked` naming the budget (the snapshot comparison runs first); it is not a round and not a swap.
   - A failed call goes through the snapshot comparison above.
3. **4.3 Slice checks and slice review.**
   - After parallel calls return, run each slice's checks yourself, one command at a time. A command several slices name runs once and counts for each of them. A slice that ran alone ran its own checks; read its results.
   - Confirm each report against `git status` and `git diff`: the changed files are the files the slice owns, and the report matches the tree.
   - Review each slice. First mark its new files with `git add -N <file>`, by name, never a directory and never anything under `.reimagine/`. Then read `git diff <merge-base> -- <slice files>` against the acceptance criteria and the scope rule. Then run `git ls-files --eol -- <slice files>`. A new file whose working-tree ending differs from the expected one is a finding; files shown as `-text` or `none` are not compared.
   - Mark each finding blocking (the change would ship wrong behavior, break an acceptance criterion, or violate a repository rule) or non-blocking, with a reason.
   - Send the findings back to the same implementer with SendMessage, after a snapshot. When that implementer cannot be continued, start a fresh implementer with the findings and the slice's current diff. Each send is a round for that slice.
4. **4.4 Cap.** A slice gets at most three rounds. Fix a non-blocking finding only inside the slice's files and scope; otherwise defer it with a reason. After the cap, fix any blocking finding yourself, once; that fix is not a round, and it is logged in `run.md`. Review the result and rerun the slice's checks. A finding still open ends the run `blocked`.
5. **4.5 Re-evaluation.** Judge the risk floor and the higher-risk rule of `risk.md` on the actual diff from the merge-base. The floor never falls. Log the result and the Step 5 role it selects in `run.md`. Do not repeat the plan review.

Write Step 4's entry `complete`, with each slice's `status`, `run` and `tickets` under `slices`, keeping the slices of prior runs, and go to Step 5.

## Step 5 Final review

1. **5.1 Integrate.** With every slice in place, run the full set of checks (the 3.7.3 list) one command at a time under the check budget. A check that passed at baseline and fails now is fixed before review, through the implementer that owns the failing code (snapshot first), and rerun. This fix is not a round, and it repeats at most three times before the run ends `blocked` naming the check. From here every edit to the tree is logged in `run.md` with its time and reason.
2. **5.2 One role over the whole diff.** Judge the higher-risk rule of `risk.md` before every round. One role reviews the complete diff from the merge-base. First check `git diff <merge-base> --stat`; an empty diff is never sent, and is recorded as "no changes". Make no edit while a pass runs.
   - Not higher-risk: the fresh reviewer of the Reviewer request in `steps/1-plan.md`, with its swap rule. Give it the request text, the plan, the inputs, the acceptance criteria and the disposition of every prior finding, and tell it to read `git diff <merge-base>` itself after new files are marked with `git add -N`, or to read a patch file. Ask for the reply shape that request defines.
   - Higher-risk: the `code-review` skill. Pass the level first, then the range `<merge-base>...HEAD` with the full sha. The level is the effort hint's level, else `high`, and at least `high` on a floored run. Never pass `--comment` or `--fix`.
   - Higher-risk, but the skill is not listed, or the diff is in a worktree or an additional repository: an Agent at `opus` that reviews `diff.patch` with the acceptance criteria and the same reply shape. Write the patch from `git diff <merge-base>` after `git add -N`; for an additional repository write `diff-<slug>.patch` from `git -C <path> diff <merge-base>` (`multi-repo.md`). From run 2 on, each patch name takes the run suffix (`record.md`, Files).
   - A review pass has the review budget, 30 minutes or `timeouts.review`. Take `date` before and after it. A pass past the budget ends the run `blocked` naming the budget; it is not a round and not a swap.
3. **5.3 Findings.**
   - Merge the findings from the pass and drop duplicates.
   - Check each against the recorded rejections: this stage's rounds in `run.md` and Step 3's log in `plan.md`. A repeated finding with no new evidence keeps its disposition.
   - Verify the rest yourself against the code.
   - Fix the confirmed blocking findings and the in-scope non-blocking ones in one batch for the round, through the implementer of the slice that owns the code, after a snapshot. Defer the others with a reason. Reject what does not hold, with a reason.
   - A fix is made only when a later round remains to see it. The third round therefore fixes nothing: a confirmed blocking finding in it ends the run `blocked`, and the other findings are deferred or rejected.
4. **5.4 Later rounds.** Judge the higher-risk rule again. Each round uses a fresh reviewer: the fresh reviewer is a new Agent, the `code-review` skill is fresh each pass, and the `opus` stand-in is continued with SendMessage and the refreshed patch. Once the run is higher-risk it never goes back. The cap of three rounds is shared by everything that sends work through Step 5, including rounds that 6.5 adds. The stage ends when a round's reviewer reports no blocking finding and you hold none.
5. **5.5 Record.** For each round log in `run.md`: the role and the criterion that selected it; for each `code-review` pass the round, the level, the range and the result; for each stand-in pass the round and the patch file; and each rejected finding with its reason.

Write Step 5's entry `complete` and go to Step 6.

## Step 6 Checks

1. **6.1 Discovery.** Build the list in this order and drop duplicates.
   - The `.reimagine.json` `checks` list.
   - Commands the manifests define for test, lint, typecheck and build: package scripts named `test`, `lint`, `typecheck` and `build`; Makefile targets of those names; pyproject sections that imply pytest, ruff and mypy; `cargo test` and `cargo clippy`; `go test ./...` and `go vet ./...`; `gradlew check`, or `gradlew.bat check` on Windows.
   - CI jobs whose steps run one of these commands.

   A CI job that no local command maps to is deferred to CI and named, never guessed. Run every local check under the check budget, 15 minutes or `timeouts.check`. A check past 10 minutes runs in the background and is stopped with TaskStop at expiry. A check past the check budget ends the run `blocked` naming the budget; this holds for the baseline (3.7.3), 5.1 and the dependency install as well, and it is not a round. When `run.md` logs no edit since the 5.1 run, reuse that run instead of repeating it.
2. **6.2 Not run.** A check whose resource is missing (a service, a tool, a credential, a dependency) is "not run", reported with its exact command and directory. "Denied" means only a refused permission.
3. **6.3 Pass rule.** Every local check must pass, except a failure that matches the baseline failure for the same check. Match by the failing test names, never by counts. A check without test names, such as lint or typecheck, matches when it reports the same messages for the same files. Report each match with its baseline evidence. On a run with no new work, the baseline is the one that the last run to reach Step 3.7.3 recorded in `run.md`. A check only CI can run is deferred and named.
4. **6.4 Tests.** When the repository has a test suite, a behavior change needs a test. A change with none is a failure for 6.5.
5. **6.5 Fix.** A failure that is not a baseline match goes through a Step 5 round, inside the cap, and the full set runs again. With no round left, the run ends `blocked`. Step 6 runs at most three times before publication, plus one run per CI repair cycle (`ci-watch.md`).

Write Step 6's entry `complete` when the set passes under 6.3. A run with no new work whose work is already published then writes Step 7 `skipped` and ends `done`, publishing nothing; with unpublished work it goes on as below (`record.md`, An existing record, item 8). Otherwise, on the `github` host a run that passes Step 6 reads `steps/7-publish.md` and starts Step 7; this includes a run that must not publish, since the opening of Step 7 decides `prepared`. On any other host, read `pr-body.md` and write the run's body file from its `## Pull request body` template, one per repository when there are several (`multi-repo.md`), then end the run `prepared`. Every terminal state goes to Final report handling in SKILL.md.
